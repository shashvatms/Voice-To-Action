# Voice-To-Action
This project is a Voice-to-Action App designed to help professionals capture action items and key points during meetings. It listens to voice conversations, transcribes them into text, and extracts actionable information such as tasks, deadlines, and meeting summaries. The app is built using state-of-the-art NLP and speech processing technologies.
